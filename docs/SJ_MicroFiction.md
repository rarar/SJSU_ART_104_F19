Hi Liz,

Glad you landed okay! We haven’t left yet—our flight got delayed. Again. We really thought we were taking off—we got some cloud cover this afternoon and local temps dipped below 120, which the stewardess assured me was enough for the plane to lift off. But we ended up sitting on the tarmac for an hour instead. For years I thought it had to do with the landing gear; I thought anything above 120 would rupture the tires. I guess I thought that because of those driverless vehicle blow outs you always hear about—you know the ones I’m talking about. They lose a tire on the freeway because it’s so hot and the car can’t think fast enough so someone ends up dying. That’s what killed that one guy we knew from high school, I think. That or a drunk driving thing. 

Anyway, when I talked to the stewardess—I swear she looked like Mike’s sister, in a vague, they-could-be-cousins-way—she said the plane couldn’t generate enough lift to get off the tarmac if it wanted to. Something about hotter air being thinner air. So we sat on the runway for an hour before they decided we would need to try again later. So here I am, back in the terminal, typing this email while this woman’s kids lose their shit three seats down from me. 

San Jose never used to be like this. Sure, we had hot summers, and we had the fires and the smoke that would choke the breath out of the sky. (Hell, we still have the fires.) But we never had this kind of heat, especially in February. It drives you mad. The city thinks throwing up a few misters will help. It doesn’t. I’m sure you heard about the riots in East San Jose—their power’s been down for a week now. Six people have died so far—a couple kids and a few old people. Do you really think they give a shit about a few misters? If you ask me, it’s just wasting water everyone could be drinking. 

I think it’s the breeze off the peninsula I miss the most. Remember when we were kids? At least on the hot days, we had that. It made sitting out on the porch relaxing. But we can’t even sit on the porch at night anymore. When the moon is up and the sky is nothing but stars, it still floats around 100. And the breeze isn’t so much a breeze as it is hot wind. It torments you at night and then does it all over again first thing in the morning. Kind of reminds me of my ex-husband. 

Anyway, I know I’m ranting. I just miss you and miss what things used to be. It’ll be good to get everyone together again—even if it’s in Alaska. But hey, Juneau is nice this time of year. Or at least that’s what Sarah tells me. 

Love ya babe and see ya soon.
