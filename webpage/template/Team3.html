    <h4 style="display:inline; font-family: Arial Narrow; letter-spacing: 2px;"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></h4>
    <p style="display:inline;" align="justify">&nbsp; Modern society’s fixed dependence on digital technology and the internet has shown to be somewhat enlightening to many. Yet, this cybernated culture is pushing itself into a more detrimental quality of life. When social media was integrated into our lives, its sole purpose was to provide a more accessible way of socializing through online networking. Now, It has become a popular platform for easy marketing opportunities. This transformation has shaped consumer behavior and the way they interact with advertisements. In comparison to the past approaches of false marketing, the use of social media provides a more roundabout way of manipulating people as it serves as the middle-man between the companies and the consumers. This indirect form of marketing is subtle, yet, more successful being that the line that separates typical internet objects and advertisements has become harder to see. Thus comes the unreliable endorsements that are presented to us through promoted sponsorships delivered by social media influencers. This approach is highly popularized by reason of its affordability and accessibility to reach a wide target audience. This whole scheme has caused consumers to overlook health risks due to believing everything they see on the internet. As we delve deeper into this rabbit hole, we will explore the dangers of such deceptive conditions and what the future holds for our computerized culture.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Marketing Lies</span></h5>
    <p align="justify">Disclosing misleading information to the public has been an active form of unethical advertising. It’s what defines the modern term “fake content.” But where did this approach come from? According to Dr. Daniel Pope, an associate professor of history at the University of Oregon, during the late 19th century and early 20th century, in order for advertising agencies to put themselves in the business world, their techniques began to evolve.[1] However, this drove companies to issue questionable ads. Hunter Oatman-Stanford assesses examples of such, pointing out that there were many “...ads that steered consumers into dangerous territory, espousing outmoded scientific evidence or misleading half-truths to convince people that appallingly toxic products, or even deadly ones, were actually good for them[.]”[2]</p>

<p align="justify">On the surface, it may seem like most enterprises have moved past faulty ads of the early 20th century; however, its presence is still alive and kicking in today’s high-tech culture. The birth of the internet meant that people had the freedom and availability to an online computer network where they can be fed a variety of information along with access to interconnected communication amongst other folks. This gave promotional companies the opportunity to use that incentive as an advantage to publicize their brands even more because it gave them a larger global audience, thus spiking the growth of advertisements. We’ve seen how false advertising has made its way through our technology. For instance, there are online articles that pose as news outlets but hold no credibility, and yet many of us are still fooled into believing its stories. There are also videos publicized through the YouTube platform that instructs “life-hacks,” despite them being proven dangerous and inaccurate.[3] Photoshopped images are one of the most primitive examples of deceiving the public, yet certain companies still depend on this type of marketing strategy. Because the internet is so versatile and widely used, it is easy to disclose any sort of information out there. Because it is believed that the internet is authentic, it is assumed that everything on the web holds credibility. In recent years, a new breed of advertising has weaved its way into our present-day culture. Companies have taken it to a more personal level with social media influencers. These are people with substantial social media presence who sign deals with companies to promote their product. These influencers portray a near “perfect” lifestyle online to which onlookers on the other side of the screen admire and strive to accomplish a similar way of life. When these online personalities promote certain brands, their fans and followers will trust their endorsement, resulting in winning sales for the advertised product. The drawback of this is that many influencers are not looking into the products that they are blindly promoting, let alone trying the merchandise out for themselves. As we explore the specifics of this marketing strategy, we’ll discover just how simple it is for any type of business to have their brand publicized through social media.</p>

  <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">How Does Technology Come Into Play?</span></h5>
    <p align="justify">The accessibility of technology plays a dominant role in how these influencers hold so much power among consumers. In the hi-tech era that we live in, we are never truly “offline.” According to a recent study by eMarketer, the average adult spends 3 hours and 10 minutes per day on their smartphone checking emails, using social media, and making small to big purchases on their device.[4] Since the target audience is always connected to the internet, online e-commerce companies take advantage of the freedom to reach millions of web users without having to spend the high cost of retail location. For younger people who are more active online, it is revealed that a fifth of 16 to 24 year olds spend their time online more than seven hours a day every day of the week.[5] With this amount of time consumed, their consumer behavior pushes brands to create more digital engagement and interaction, allowing them to establish a brand identity. Instagram alone has 500 million active users every day, and as the large wave of people becoming active on other platforms including YouTube and Facebook, the only other way companies can create engagement and conversion are through these social media influencers.[6] This has slowly transformed the structure of being a user on social media in a way that becoming an online influencer is suddenly considered to be official “job”. The accessibility to gain more engagement with a large target outreach as marketers are able to benefit from more investment returns while still pleasing audiences with lower costs has all seemed to pressure the influencers to carelessly create a system that pushes the digital world into a fraudulent one.</p>

  <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Skinny Tea & Smile Direct Club</span></h5>
    <p align="justify">There are several companies who serve as examples of providing such misleading product information that is delivered online through paid sponsorships. Such that includes the acclaimed Skinny Tea. This weight loss product quickly became popular amongst social media gurus and has been promoted by hundreds of influencers including the Kardashians. Until recently, it has been revealed that this product actually flushes out your system, resulting in alarming side effects for people who rely on crucial medication, such as women’s use of birth control. According to Dr. Virginia Beckett, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, she explains, “Detox teas which contain senna leaf may have a laxative effect which can cause diarrhea or vomiting. If this happens, the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill may be reduced.”[7] Many people become unaware of this side effect as it is rarely discussed or mentioned during such popular endorsements.</p>

    <p align="justify">Another form of false advertising is sponsoring with Smile Direct Club. It’s reported that this do-it-yourself teeth straightening clear aligner company has spent $289.3 million last year on social marketing.[8] This example demonstrates how influencer marketing on digital platforms have led consumers to overlook the health risks of the product. The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO)  have issued health warnings to consumers about these do-it-yourself, direct-to-consumer orthodontics. There are countless reports from The AAO and the American Dental Association stating the dangers of these do-it-yourself teeth straightening therapies, including tooth loss, nerve damage, and bite misalignment. In 2019, orthodontic groups and consumers have hit Smile Direct Club with action lawsuits due to violating federal law; however, this did not stop such misleading advertising to continue rising as, “Instagram influencers are being paid thousands of dollars to promote teeth-straightening products online, sparking complaints from the dental industry that laws governing disclosure of these arrangements are being broken.”[9]</p>

        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Who's Responsible?</span></h5>

    <p align="justify">As this form of deceptive consumerism carries its heavy presence all throughout social media platforms, it begs the question, what kind of effect does it leave us? Besides health concerns, think bigger. Fake content on the internet is shaping our lives and how we function. From the beginning of the day until the end, we look at the devices that feed us with false information. With such unauthentic products and experiences taking control of our lives, it is modifying our everyday behavior and psychological thinking, as it leaves people with the lingering fear of missing out, also known as FOMO. This brings up the question of who is responsible for the potential harm done by these products. The company and their ambiguous marketing tactics? Or the influencer who is the one that is influenced by the tempting payment of a sponsorship? What can be done to prevent a relay of such inaccurate information to float around? According to criminal and regulatory law specialist, Tanveer Qureshi, he explains the Advertising Standards Authority and its relation to influencer marketing in the UK:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 5em;" align="justify">While the reasons for the power of influencers is still being grappled with, it is widely believed that consumers have lost faith in traditional banner advertising and are increasingly likely to trust people. However, due to the huge attraction of influencer marketing, regulators including the ASA have been forced to provide guidance to ensure influencers do not fall foul of advertising rules.  Its guidance makes clear that content may be considered an advertisement if the influencer was paid, or was given a freebie, or the brand had editorial control.  And if content is technically advertising, the content must make this clear to the audience.  Influencers also need to ensure they back-up any claims made.[10]</p>

    <p align="justify">Thus, with the increase in such marketing, the influencer themselves must take the responsibility in relaying the advertised message in an accurate and well-researched manner. Much like the ASA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a list of regulations for disclosure of sponsorships with influencers in the US.[11] Although this guide “does not hold the force of law, it can help influencers stay within the law”.[12] Similarly, although the UK’s ASA and CAP (Committee of Advertising Practice) “are not legally empowered to enforce adherence to their rules,” Quershi clarifies:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 5em;" align="justify">[That] sanctions can be provided.  This includes requiring the advertisement to be amended or withdrawn, issuing alerts to other members advising them to withhold access to advertising space.  CAP can also ask internet search providers to remove paid search advertisements which link to a page on the marketer’s website containing content which breaks the rules.[13]</p>

      <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">The Current Consequences</span></h5>

    <p align="justify">As previously discussed, the presence of false advertising has existed for centuries in our consumerist society forasmuch as its been capable of evolving with our technological and economical advancements. The most recent method of such deceptive promoting has invaded social media and utilizes influencers to target 21st century consumers. These particular individuals hold a lot of power over their followers--those who look up to them. Thus, promoting sponsorships with contracted businesses benefits both the influencer themselves and their companies. However, an influencer’s power is not the only intention for these agencies to gear towards, as technology usage became a push for them to do so. At this point, we are in a position where promoting fake content has put people at risk in terms of crippling one’s health and manipulating the behaviors of many. Despite this, there are still consequences that these marketers will face if they do not comply with the regulations, including  adverse publicity if [failure] to rectify or remove advertisements on their websites or other non-paid-for space,” and along with “the name of the individual or business and the identified issue with their advertising [becoming] featured on a dedicated section of the ASA website…[in order to] appear in search engine results when an end user searches for a company.”[14] So long as social media influencers choose their sponsors responsibly and do their research in the product that they are endorsing, they will be able to prevent this ongoing pattern of false advertising.</p>
