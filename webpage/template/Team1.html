    <h3>Global Warming, and Why Focus on Transportation?</h3>
    <p>The causes and solutions of global warming are often lost in the controversy on whether or not it actually exists. In this document we are seeking to reject political dialogue and speak solely to the existence of global warming, and what means of transportation must we use in order to reduce the effects of it. In making such effort it is important to understand the basic principles of the global warming so that we may be more effective in our individual small part to help fix it. Our planet has a system of absorbing energy in the form of visible light from the sun, and dissipating unused energy back into space in the form of infrared radiation. The visible light we get from the sun is rarely blocked from our planet, as clouds are a degree of translucent, yet the infrared light emitted from our planet’s surface is blocked increasingly by the presence of exorbitant greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in our planet’s atmosphere is not unusual on earth, as having them in our atmosphere is what sustains our warm survivable climate on Earth in the first place. Yet, when humanity started burning fossil fuels, clearing land, and increasing agriculture the presence of greenhouse gases has dramatically increased, blocking too much of the energy Earth is emitting. This is called the greenhouse effect, and it is the main cause for global warming. If Earth can’t dissipate its infrared radiation it will continue to warm. Global warming may sound misleading as it does not in fact mean that everywhere on the planet is getting warmer, rather it means that the overall raise in Earth’s temperature is causing climate change. This climate change can manifest in more ways than just a hotter outside. For example the jet stream on earth is determined by change in air temperature, so when the Arctic begins to melt. This causes the stream to change shape and carry cold air from the Arctic elsewhere. This change in the jet stream alone has already caused increasingly colder weather in parts of Asia and Europe. With time, changes in our climate can become more drastic and detrimental to a community even if it’s not the fault of the affected community.  </p>
    <p>For this reason it is all of our responsibility to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet just knowing how global warming is caused isn’t enough to actually solve it. As environmental pursuits bleed into popular media, companies have tried to monetize it with means of marketing and product design. To combat being deceived by illegitimate eco-friendly claims, we seek to critically analyze aggregated impacts of Electric Cars, Electric Scooters, Ride-Sharing, and Public Transportation. In doing so may we find the most effective way to cut down emissions from our busy lives and commutes.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Electric Vehicles</span></h5>
<p>Silicon Valley boasts many titles and achievements. It likes to be looked upon as the bleeding edge of technology and even progressive thought. It’s fitting that it’s also home to the manufacturer of America’s most popular electric vehicle: the Tesla Model 3. If you find yourself driving in the Bay Area— and let’s not think about traffic right now— you are very likely to come across one of Tesla’s EV lineup. Even if you just hopped in the car to head down the street to pick up your dry-cleaning, a betting man would wager you’d drive by more than one. This just speaks to the growing popularity of electric vehicles in general. Ever since the debut of An Inconvenient Truth, climate change and global warming have been a growing concern for the public, which led automakers to jump at the opportunity for capitalizing on this concern. In the early days, an electric vehicle or hybrid was synonymous with environmentally conscious. They were expensive though, so only the die-hard tree huggers found themselves in the driver seat. As technology improved and an argument for saving money at the pump was formed, EV’s made their way into more and more driveways. The government of California even supported consumer efforts by providing incentives between $2,500 to $4,500 in rebate when purchasing a battery electric vehicle. </p>
<p>There are concerns, however, that EV’s may not deserve all the praise they’ve generated. Even though the amount of emissions produced by EV’s while on the road is significantly less than gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, some argue the manufacturing process for batteries makes up the difference. This concern, however, is largely linked to the location and methods of production. A 2016 study compared the manufacturing process of batteries for electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) in China and discovered 60% more emissions were produced during the battery manufacturing process. This is extremely concerning since China is responsible for approximately one quarter of global vehicle production but scientists suggest this is correctable. The study concluded that if China were to adopt the same manufacturing processes that have been implemented in countries like the U.S., the comparison between BEV and ICEV production would be equal. Another study conducted by The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) discovered that the emissions debt produced during the battery manufacturing process was quickly paid off. After only two years on the road, an electric vehicle’s emissions output equals that of a comparable ICEV. That number drops to approximately one and a half years if the vehicle was charged using renewable energy. That clears up that concern but what happens to vehicle batteries after its no longer fit to run? </p>
<p>After the battery in an electric vehicle is deemed useless, there is actually still some juice left inside. There may not be enough power left to effectively and safely run a vehicle on the road but those batteries can still be used as reserve storage for solar panels and wind turbines. Many start-ups are expecting the day when a mass of used batteries reach the end of their vehicular life cycle to swoop in and reclaim them for these opportunities. While some believe the best option for old batteries is to reuse them for other applications, others believe it may be more profitable to extract raw materials such as cobalt to make new batteries. On top of that, thankfully countries like China are implementing regulations that will keep automakers accountable for used batteries in order to keep them out of landfills.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Electric Rentable Scooters</span></h5>
    <p>Electric powered personal transportation is a reality of the modern world that incites mixed feelings and mixed impacts on the environment. Electric powered transportation seems like it would have a positive impact in any form it takes. However, it is possible for the manufacturing of these eco-friendly devices to have an impact on global warming that outweighs many of the benefits of using the product in the first place. In particular rentable electric scooters for example seem more eco-friendly than a gas bus, but it turns out that electric scooters actually have worse emission levels than a bus per mile when accounting for its manufacturing process and lifespan.</p>
    <p>It seemed that overnight electric scooters littered the rural landscapes of cities and boosted boards became a YouTube staple. In fact a study in November 2018 found about 70% of US citizens think of electric personal transportation positively. Yet, with research into the environmental impacts of the rentable electric scooter business we may collectively look upon the service more critically. In doing so the hope is the care, usage, and manufacturing of the new popular transportation method of scooters can be executed more responsibly. Electric scooters are heavy to lug around, charge at home and expensive to purchase. So when rentable scooters became available on our streets, the market experienced more demand and the rate of scooter usage has grown with it. This at first may sound great, as more people use electric scooters they hopefully use gas-powered cars less, atleast in smaller commutes. However, a study from IOP Science has found that the manufacturing of these scooters, and the methods for charging combined give the scooter an emission value too high to be actually net positive for the environment. Let alone the scooter can't provide the same distance of travel when compared to a car. Regardless, the study found the problem with the manufacturing of electric scooters is the materials and energy needed to assemble them makes up half of their impact on global warming. Manufacturing will hurt the score for any eco-friendly product that needs to be commercially produced. Yet, even if scooters got a bit of leeway for this, it is only half the story. The other half of their impact comes from actual usage and disposal. This is due to ther charging, storing, and collection methods. When they are deployed they are not docked to a station that charges them, rather for consumer convenience almost every company that is in the rentable scooter business pays people to collect the scooters and charge them in their own homes. The study from IOP found this also contributes to the overall impact on global warming as the collection and charging of the scooters is an inefficient expenditure of energy in itself. According to the EPA, Electricity production accounts for 27.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, making it the second largest contributor in the US. Which is why the methods for charging hundreds of scooter is so important. Rentable scooters never really posed a threat to replacing the average gas powered car, but the hope is they might be able to at least serve as an option for short range travel, but for now they don't provide enough of a short term benefit to justify their environmental impact.</p>
    <p>Not all hope is lost for electric scooters as the study concludes with suggestions about how to potentially improve the scooters efficiency, yet the fact they only last around two years already means the rate at which they need to be manufactured won’t be improved until they last longer. Even if they could last longer the disposal techniques for scooters is not perfect. Often broken scooters are left in the street, or in the wrong place littering our communities. Furthermore if the companies such as Bird or Lime retrieve broken scooters they currently do not provide the public with recycling information, casting doubt on whether or not it is being done responsibly. In conclusion rentable electric scooters in their current form are not not a more eco-friendly alternative to walking, or even taking a bus small distances where the car may not make sense in the first place.</p>

        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Ride-Sharing</span></h5>
        <p>In the worst-case scenario that public scooters are completely unsustainable, then people could still fall back on delivery services, between ridesharing through Lyft and Uber, and ordering takeout food with meal kit deliveries. Needless to say, we already have too many cars to keep for themselves and drive on the road, and unless we refrain ourselves for buying more of them, this transport problem could only get worse now and in the future. One statistic reporting on the time period of 2006 to 2014, already proves that each person would rather use 3 personal passenger cars than just one commercial car. Likewise, a corporate prediction reveals the world’s number of vehicles would double to over 2 billion cars by 2040, so addressing better transport is all the more urgent as of now. The good news is, though, that often people underestimate the environmental importance of the ridesharing market. With this economic in our lifestyles, fewer cars would appear on highways and freeways due to public services reusing them to carry people around for them. Although more spacious highways and freeways would just be the beginning of people’s new interest in ridesharing. All cars would still emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making global warming more of a reality, but reusing cars to share rides would lead to fewer cars appearing publicly, and thus fewer cars would pollute less of the air, saving it. The proof of this ridesharing benefit would be said industry expanding from a $15 billion market into one worth $335 billion, a reasonable argument! </p>
<p>However, we just cover the first part of a ridesharing-based future: the pros of ride sharing. Even if public transport services become more abundant with ride sharing drivers, this ideal future would have its own cons or disadvantages. The University of California, Davis studied transportation in 2017, and it discovered that more people would share rides in Uber or Lyft instead of taking the bus or the usual taxi service. Between the relatively small supply of ride sharing services and their new growing demand from clients, this solution to traffic congestion and carbon emission would ironically put even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But this is not to say that this is Uber’s only solution for today’s world, with or without its flaws. Uber has been preparing backup plans to resolve the environmental and social problems at hand, from making electric vehicles to replace the ones run on gas and oil, to encouraging new drivers on the potential of said transports. Although the cons for even those initiatives, would include local and national tax laws holding drivers back from embracing electric driving and the vehicles themselves running out of charge. Even Lyft is taking its own path in reducing its carbon footprint, which “buying” carbon offsets, or paying people to not emit as much carbon as another person would. Obviously, Lyft’s financial strategy has the flaw of being a temporary answer to an everlasting problem; but then again, people coming up with questionable solutions to today’s world is better than them not coming up with anything at all.</p>

            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Public Transportation and Conclusion</span></h5>
            <p>Public transportation had its start in the 17th century. However, it wasn’t until the early 19th century when it became part of the urban landscape. Public transport has an important role in the urban conflict against global climate change. It focuses on improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, and finding ways to conserve land and decrease travel. It uses all of its different forms ranging from light rail to buses to try and create a better living environment for the urban population. Public Transportation is one of the easiest ways to combat the problem of global climate change. </p>
            <p>Improving air quality is simple with the many different ways of transporting that is offered. The two main ways of transporting include buses and rail vehicles. Buses have made a big push towards the sustainability side. They have begun to use alternative gases. These new gases include compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas or fuel cells. Traditional diesel buses are being replaced with bio-diesel and hybrid diesel. And most rail transit vehicles produce little to no emissions because they run on electricity.</p>
            <p>In the United States transportation accounts for twenty-nine percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Public transportation aims to lower this by being able to move more people using less vehicles. The use of subways and metros produces on average seventy-six percent less greenhouse gas. The light rail produces sixty-two percent less. And lastly, buses produce thirty-three percent less emissions. Just by looking at those statistics it is easy to see that public transportation is much better than individual transportation. In addition, fewer vehicles mean that there will be less traffic congestion, which means there will be fewer vehicles stuck in traffic emitting even more greenhouse gases.</p>
            <p>Even though the positive effects for the environment are known by the users of  rideshare services they still choose to opt for those due to convenience. People are willing to pay a marked up price of up to 50% if it means a more convenient ride to their destination. Anything more than that and that is when people begin to question if they should use a rideshare service or just use a cheaper public transportation. However, as of now rideshare services are not too much more expensive than public transportation, which leads to an increased use of them due to their convenience. This has led to increased traffic congestion due to the massive increase in cars that are on the road. What this has caused is there to be a slower speed of travel. And this has led to public transportation being affected in its speed as well. Due to the convenience of rideshare services they are becoming more  preferable to the population, despite their increased negative effects on the environment.</p>
            <p>Land conservation is another added benefit to the use of public transportation. By having a higher use of public transportation that means that there will be less need for parking space for individual cars. Meaning there will be a reduced distance and time traveled  between destinations for the population. This compact development increases the amount of land that is left for parks, wildlife reserves, and forests. Since, there will be a decreased need for land there will be less pavement that needs to be poured which means there will be less run-off to the water supplies. Overall, land conservation will help combat the looming problem of global climate change.</p>
            <p>Overall, public transportation has little to no negative effects on the environment. The negative includes that it still contributes to climate change. However, the impact is much less of that than regular forms of transportation. In addition to saving fuel, increased public transportation will lead to less energy being used. Land conservation will be another added benefit. Public transportation should be the push we aim for in the future if we want to start going towards a more sustainable future of transportation.</p>
