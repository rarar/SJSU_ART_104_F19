    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Bioengineering has become a technology with great advances, especially in Genome editing has become a possibility with the first genome editing technology introduced in the late 1900s. In 2009, a new genome editing was created called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR- associated protein 9, CRISPR-Cas9 for short. This development in technology allows humans to edit strands of DNA to prevent and treat diseases. However, this technology can also be used for more than that. What if people can start designing their offspring. They can have a baby without diseases and even better maybe women would not have to go through the pain of giving birth. This is exactly what JianKui, a Chinese scientist did. He was a Chinese scientist who through his idea for a company that would genetically engineer children to resist heart attacks, HIV, and other health problems led him to create the world’s first gene-edited babies. JianKui, however, broke several ethnic guidelines in the science community to achieve this. The science community was outraged by his unethical conduct. Besides the ethical and legal problems with this issue, now the possibility of growing your own designer baby has become a reality, the world needs to rethink their values on this. Should humans be able to genetically modify their children so that they are resistant to certain diseases or even look a certain way? What are the problems that could arise if this were approved by society? Being able to change someone’s genetic is a powerful tool. In which situations could this be allowed? Although this could bring a future of a healthier, prettier, more powerful generation of humans, it could be taken advantage of as well. What if these engineered babies were used as a product, a commodity in which people could buy and use them as they’d like. In this paper, we will discuss the creation of designer babies and the possible impacts it could have on future societies.  </p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Today, design is everywhere in the world, it can happen in any field. In recent years, genome editing has become possible with the first genome editing technology introduced in the late 1900s. It is no longer an illusion that people can genetically design babies during pregnancy. Although this is an improvement in human science, it is flawed. The design of genes may cause great damage to the baby, resulting in side effects on the body structure. In addition, the emergence of design baby could potentially lead to social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor.</p>

<h3>Designers</h3>

<p>The first instance of bioengineering humans occured when Jian Kui a Chinese scientist, who through his idea for a company that would genetically engineer children to resist heart attack, HIV, and other health problems. This led him to create the world's first gene-edited babies. Initially Jian Kui had hoped to “turn designer humans into a medical tourism business” Later he shocked the scientific and general world by announcing that he had edited the DNA of twin girls using gene engineering technology CRISPR  in an attempt to make them immune to HIV. The effects this will have on the twins cannot be known until they have grown up. The cons of this bioengineering experiment are great.  Since Jian Kui refused and even pushed away supervision it is ethical to say that he had potentially used unsafe and ineffective gene-editing methods on the children during the gene-editing process. As they grow the children's bodies may start to reject the altered genes and this could cause defects in or on their bodies. This experiment may also have done the exact opposite and opened the twins up to be more susceptible to heart attacks, HIV or any other health problems. Jian Kui violated Chinese laws by doing this without permission, going behind the nations back and crossed the line of the natural order of life for personal fame and fortune. 
</p>

<p>Although Jian Kui’s experiment was largely frowned upon by a group of people, there are others who feel like Jian Kui was on to something. These people saw bioengineering people as the future. Take Josiah Zayner for example. He is an American born 38-year-old “Biohacker” and scientist who is best known for “his self-experimentation and his work making hands-on genetic engineering accessible to the consumer audience, this includes CRISPR”. When the public started complaining about these kits, Zayner responded by saying “[their] fears were based on misunderstandings of the product, as genetic experiments on yeast and bacteria cannot produce a viral epidemic.”  Zayner has made a living by selling CRISPR kits to let the general public experiment with editing bacterial DNA. “ODIN” the name of his company, currently has 4 employees, operates out of Zayners garage and these kits also are sold there. In February 2016, Zayner attempted a full-body microbiome transplant on himself, which included a fecal transplant. He wanted to experiment with microbiome engineering and to see if he could treat his gastrointestinal issues. He was the first person to attempt to edit his own genes this way and be seemingly successful.</p>

 <p>Now while no mutations have been found on or in Zayner recently, the fact that he did this live-streamed experiment at the Biotech conference, and with no medical license is cause for concern and he is currently under investigation. Unfortunately, Zayner has become a “Biohacking” celebrity and has developed followers who are also self-proclaimed “Biohackers”. These people experiment on their own bodies without going to traditional labs or hospitals with the hope of boosting their physical and cognitive performance. Zayner’s success story may not last as long as he thinks it will, mutations could start occurring in or on him at any time in the future and the fact that his followers have already started experimenting on themselves after seeing his live-streamed CRISPR injection is an even greater problem. 
</p>

<p>Bioengineering another human being’s DNA can cause great amounts of future harm.  This risk that Jian Kui took to bioengineer these kids may not result in a good thing. He could have potentially ruined their lives before they even got to live them. It’s the same with Zayner but with his “biohacking” followers, one of the biggest problems with both Jian and Zayners experiments is that we can not currently view or prevent any mutations that may occur from these experiments. </p>

<h3>Backlash</h3>

<p>The science community was upset about the CRISPR-Cas9 in embryonic genome editing because of the ethical concerns in terms of how to how to be distributed evenly in order not to create a "disease of poverty", it has disadvantages in certain diseases, and it has the potential to change the whole biogenetic system. In article Analyzing The Potential And Ethical Questions Surrounding CRISPR-CAS9 In Embryonic Genome Editing Michael Albert Hanamirian Jr defines, "CRISPR-Cas9 is a type of protein and complementary guide RNA to cut out an unwanted gene and then engineer the desired gene to replace what was cut out". It can be both treatment and enhancement. First, if the genome editing technology is either expensive or scarce, the significant difficulty is the distribution of resources, to ensure the new medical treatment can be available to any individuals. Distributive justice is the key to avoid making a "disease of poverty". For instance, hemodialysis has been distributed for only high-class because of insufficient resources in Seattle. It is certainly unacceptable. It will initiate contradictions to have adverse impact to the society. Second, even though many cases have done successfully on animals and plants by genome editing, it is still not confident to human beings. CRISPR-Cas9 can lead to unwanted cleavage at a non-target site such as when a mutation only occurs in a few but not all cells. Besides, some genetic mutations of adults maybe not correctable. The somatic cell genome editing has systemic effects when trying to fix genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease because there are over millions of cells contain the genetic disease in the human body. Third, the primary ethical concern is how to use technology wisely. In the previous article, Hanamirian Jr mentions that CRISPR-Cas9 protein can be used either for changing the DNA or using on the somatic cells of human beings to fight for cancer and any other diseases or disorder. According to the history of purchasing livestock and racehorses, some people are willing to pay extra for the extraordinary genetics so that the embryonic genome editing may be opening the door to eugenics. If only the wealthy can afford to change their child's genes, they may consider themselves superior to any other human who can not afford to undergo genome enhancement. On the other hand, if people use genome editing for the somatic cells, they can enhance their skin or eye colours, height, IQ, sexuality, and even personality. Here is some evidence to prove it. If you open google researching engine, it is easy to find many hospitals providing artificial insemination to choose the gender and ensure 100% succeed. For example, China has a law to control the occurrence of the situation; many people seek an international agency to make it happen. Since it is the men dominated society, people tend to have boys rather than girls. While some people just wanted to pursue the perfection to have a boy and a girl. One of my friends is working at HTEC & HMFP China Center, which is one of the agencies to provide this kind of service. They help people who can afford to give birth in America by artificial insemination to choose their child's gender. Assuming we humans are made by nature, the genome editing could change the environment to lead species evolution. Therefore, it will cause more social problems.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>Bioengineering is a still a newly explored field of science and now it is almost as if we have a whole new toy at our disposal. What can this toy do? What are its limitations? Are there things we should not do with this new toy? The world of science fiction has explored many aspects with this fascination with the bioengineering field and how far we could take it, particularly with the idea of creating clones or hosts. What if this technology allows us to participate in biotic games involving humans? In a short animation by artist Tom Jude, open source synthetic bioengineering is available for everyone to use. A young man uses this source to grow his very own gaming character which he could control. After the game was over, the young man discarded this character (Judd). This is a very interesting take on how synthetic bioengineered humans could be treated. They could be treated just another consumer product that could be used and discarded at the owners will, regardless of the “life” it may contain. This consumerism use for a synthetically produced human is famously explored by Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel Never Let Me Go. In this dystopian world, clones are raised as normal children in an institution. “As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs” (Spark Notes). This version fiction shows a future of bioengineering  where humans become expendable and consumer products, but what about discussions about this technology in the real world. </p>

<p>As technology stands right now, it is difficult if not impossible to design a whole being. But on the assumption that it will be possible, there are some concerns that appear.  In the future, there is no doubt that bioengineering would benefit us, “synthetic biology offers promise for developments to benefit health, such as innovative drugs, new vaccines, tissue regeneration or even entirely synthetic cells (Mirnov). But despite the benefits, there are many who are still wary of the technology. Fears range from people wanting to place restrictions and regulations on the technology to others such as Yuval Harari who believes “the third largest threat to human existence in the 21st century: technology disruption...particularly in the fields of bioengineering and artificial intelligence will soon give humankind unprecedented, godlike powers.” In the article, CRISPR in Military, Greene, and Master explores the idea if this technology was used for genetic enhancement to weaponized biological agents. If this were to happen it could change the way wars are fought. If only a select few allowed this genetic enhancement, a class separation between those who are genetically advanced (modified) and those who are normal cold occur, disrupting society. If genetic modification is not accessible to everyone but the rich only, this class separation would be even more drastic. In the article, The Case Against Perfection, this future is described as “A Gattaca-like world in which parents become accustomed to speficying the sex and genetic traits of children would be a world inhospitable to the unbidden, a gated community writ large (Sandel).  </p>

<p>With fear of this amazing technology affecting society and how it functions. Without denying its benefits we have to cautiously set parameters and restrictions on how something like CRISPR should be used. The answer seems to revolve “between practices that are considered morally permissible (gene editing for therapeutic purposes) versus those that are prohibitory (gene editing for enhancement) (Green and Master). As if right now using CRISPR on embryos is still in a development stage. Since the effects are unpredictable this is not something that is approved by the scientific community. But if there would be a safe way to test this technology on humans in the future, there is nothing wrong with using it to help with disease and society as long as boundaries between medical necessities and genetic enhancements are made.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although genetic engineering is an improvement of human science, it is still a field that needs to be explored. The appearance of design baby skill can make design baby's gene more excellent, meanwhile, it may have the opposite effect. As design babies grow up, their bodies may begin to reject changing genes. This makes them more vulnerable to heart disease, AIDS or other health problems. On the other hand, the appearance of design baby will bring the serious social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor and the problem of discrimination. This is because only the rich can afford to design babies. At the same time, the birth of design babies makes these babies commercialized. The problem of human comparison and discrimination is more serious. The risk of bioengineering is huge. With where the technology stands right now, bioengineering another person's DNA can cause many hazards. Scientists should be committed to the research of solving the existing major diseases, rather than creating harm to human beings on the basis of scientific progress.</p>
