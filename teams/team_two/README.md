With new technology, the artificial intelligence incorporated into more aspects of our daily lives. It has revamped how we consume information. As such, we can note that the informational experiences controlled by machines have changed the way we think and live. Itâ€™s also the topic that artists would like to start to experiment with it. 

Parts:

Who have ownership of the art project that create by the AI? Is artist? Is the machine or software? If a robot create a art work, but the robot is create by a person, who have ownership of that art work?
