Art patronage influencing art media

**Emilios Focus**

I want to focus on ecofriendly products and how marketing can either help bring awareness to an issue or it can drown out other companies/non profits that may be doing more work for the envrionment.

If anyone asks, I couldn't stop thinking about the important role of patronage and commissions in art history. Because royal families and other wealthy people demanded certain works of art to be made, we got sfumato the technique in painting and CGI for animation. So now I want to ask the question, "What more could art patrons ask for?"

Sustainable Tech of ‘19

Emilio:

Electric and human powered personal transportation is a reality of the modern world that incites mixed feelings and mixed impacts on the environment. Electric powered transportation seems like it would have a positive impact in any form it takes and for the most part it is good for our planet. However, it is possible for the manufacturing of these eco-friendly devices to have an impact on global warming that outweighs many of the benefits of using the product. Identifying the net impact of a mode for transportation is important, as the impression of a particular method may persuade you to believe it is eco-friendly while actually being worse than a bus per mile!

A particular mode of electric transport is rentable scooters. It seemed that overnight electric scooters littered the rural landscapes of cities and boosted boards became a YouTube staple. In fact a study in November 2018 found about 70% of US citizens think of electric personal transport positively. Bikes, electric scooters, and skateboards are the main methods of personal transport in major metropolitan areas. Electric scooters are heavy to lug around, charge at home and expensive to purchase. So when rentable scooters became available the market for scooters saw more demand and the rate of scooter usage has increased. This at first may give the impression of eco-friendly method of transport, as more people use electric scooters they hopefully use gas-powered cars less. However, a study from IOP Science has found that the manufacturing of these scooters, and the methods for charging combined give the scooter an emission value too high to be actually net positive for the environment. The study found the problem with the manufacturing is the materials and energy needed to assemble them makes up half of their impact on global warming. Furthermore when they are deployed they are not docked to a station that charges them, rather for consumer convenience almost every company that is in the rentable scooter business pays people to collect the scooters and charge them in their own homes. The study from IOP found this also contributes to the overall impact on global warming as the collection and charging of the scooters is an inefficient expenditure of energy in itself. Not all hope is lost for electric scooters as the study concludes with suggestions about how to potentially improve the scooters efficiency, yet the fact they only last around two years already means the rate at which they need to be manufactured won’t be improved until they last longer. For now bike and skateboard is the only sure way to be eco-friendly.

In the worst-case scenario that public scooters are completely unsustainable, then people could still fall back on delivery services, between ridesharing through Lyft and Uber, and ordering takeout food with meal kit deliveries. Needless to say, we already have too many cars to keep for themselves and drive on the road, and unless we refrain ourselves for buying more of them, this transport problem could only get worse now and in the future. One statistic reporting on the time period of 2006 to 2014, already proves that each person would rather use 3 personal passenger cars than just one commercial car. Likewise, a corporate prediction reveals the world’s number of vehicles would double to over 2 billion cars by 2040, so addressing better transport is all the more urgent as of now. The good news is, though, that often people underestimate the environmental importance of the ridesharing market. With this economic in our lifestyles, fewer cars would appear on highways and freeways due to public services reusing them to carry people around for them. Although more spacious highways and freeways would just be the beginning of people’s new interest in ridesharing. All cars would still emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making global warming more of a reality, but reusing cars to share rides would lead to fewer cars appearing publicly, and thus fewer cars would pollute less of the air, saving it. The proof of this ridesharing benefit would be said industry expanding from a $15 billion market into one worth $335 billion, a reasonable argument!

We just cover the first part of a ridesharing-based future, however. If public services are becoming ever more abundant in transporting people, so too are services that help deliver takeout food to residencies. The main reason for promoting food deliveries might be that the food itself is more environmentally beneficial than the average produce at the market.

Public transportation had its start in the 17th century. However, it wasn’t until the early 19th century when it became part of the urban landscape. Public transport has an important role in the urban conflict against global climate change. It focuses on improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, and finding ways to conserve land and decrease travel. It uses all of its different forms ranging from light rail to buses to try and create a better living environment for the urban population. Public Transportation is one of the easiest ways to combat the problem of global climate change.
Improving air quality is simple with the many different ways of transporting that is offered. The two main ways of transporting include buses and rail vehicles. Buses have made a big push towards the sustainability side. They have begun to use alternative gases. These new gases include compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas or fuel cells. Traditional diesel buses are being replaced with bio-diesel and hybrid diesel. And most rail transit vehicles produce little to no emissions because they run on electricity. 

In the United States transportation accounts for twenty-nine percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Public transportation aims to lower this by being able to move more people using less vehicles. The use of subways and metros produces on average seventy-six percent less greenhouse gas. The light rail produces sixty-two percent less. And lastly, buses produce thirty-three percent less emissions. Just by looking at those statistics it is easy to see that public transportation is much better than individual transportation. In addition, fewer vehicles mean that there will be less traffic congestion, which means there will be fewer vehicles stuck in traffic emitting even more greenhouse gases. 
Land conservation is another added benefit to the use of public transportation. By having a higher use of public transportation that means that there will be less need for parking space for individual cars. Meaning there will be a reduced distance and time traveled  between destinations for the population. This compact development increases the amount of land that is left for parks, wildlife reserves, and forests. Since, there will be a decreased need for land there will be less pavement that needs to be poured which means there will be less run-off to the water supplies. Overall, land conservation will help combat the looming problem of global climate change. 
Overall, public transportation has little to no negative effects on the environment. The negative includes that it still contributes to climate change. However, the impact is much less of that than regular forms of transportation. In addition to saving fuel, increased public transportation will lead to less energy being used. Land conservation will be another added benefit. Public transportation should be the push we aim for in the future if we want to start going towards a more sustainable future of transportation.  

Roan:

Silicon Valley boasts many titles and achievements. It likes to be looked upon as the bleeding edge of technology and even progressive thought. It’s fitting that it’s also home to the manufacturer of America’s most popular electric vehicle: the Tesla Model 3. If you find yourself driving in the Bay Area— and let’s not think about traffic right now— you are very likely to come across one of Tesla’s EV lineup. Even if you just hopped in the car to head down the street to pick up your dry-cleaning, a betting man would wager you’d drive by more than one. This just speaks to the growing popularity of electric vehicles in general. Ever since the debut of An Inconvenient Truth, climate change and global warming have been a growing concern for the public, which led automakers to jump at the opportunity for capitalizing on this concern. In the early days, an electric vehicle or hybrid was synonymous with environmentally conscious. They were expensive though, so only the die-hard tree huggers found themselves in the driver seat. As technology improved and an argument for saving money at the pump was formed, EV’s made their way into more and more driveways. The government of California even supported consumer efforts by providing incentives between $2,500 to $4,500 in rebate when purchasing a battery electric vehicle. 

There are concerns, however, that EV’s may not deserve all the praise they’ve generated. Even though the amount of emissions produced by EV’s while on the road is significantly less than gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, some argue the manufacturing process for batteries makes up the difference. This concern, however, is linked to the location and methods of production. A 2016 study compared the manufacturing process of batteries for electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) in China and discovered 60% more emissions were produced during the battery manufacturing process. This is extremely concerning since China is responsible for approximately one quarter of global vehicle production but scientists suggest this is correctable. If China were to adopt the same manufacturing processes that have been implemented in countries like the U.S., the comparison between BEV and ICEV production would be equal.
