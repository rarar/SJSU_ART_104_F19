**Emilios Focus**

I want to focus on ecofriendly products and how marketing can either help bring awareness to an issue or it can drown out other companies/non profits that may be doing more work for the envrionment.

**Chi Nguyen**

If anyone asks, I couldn't stop thinking about the important role of patronage and commissions in art history. Because royal families and other wealthy people demanded certain works of art to be made, we got sfumato the technique in painting and CGI for animation. So now I want to ask the question, "What more could art patrons ask for?"
