Ways of Seeing Response 
In the four part series with John Berger, he describes the relationship between art and technology and how it has altered our perception of how we interpret different pieces of art as well as how it changed the way we view it in our daily lives. In the first part of the 
series he discussed how newer technology has changed not only what we see but how we see it. Many classic paintings are put into a certain
environment that support the feeling of the painting is trying to perceive. In modern times often paintings our posted out of context that 
desentitise their meaning. This has not only happened with painting but photography and news articles as well. Online news articles have
allowed us to receive more information faster than ever before. We are constantly exposed to horrific murders and natural disasters that
leave us without reaction because we have become accustomed to it  even though we should be devastated. Women throughout art history have
been portrayed nude as an object to be enjoyed. They are extremely exaggerated and idealized giving women no choice but to constantly
compare themselves to the body standard and to do it so men enjoy looking at them. I would even argue that this is more common now than
ever before in history because we live in an age where millions of women get paid to post swimsuit pictures on instagram and we are
constantly exposed to impossible body standards of women posting only what they want us to see that could be nothing like their reality. 
It has come  to the point that women are using photo editing apps such as photoshop and facetoon to alter their bodies and faces so they
come off as more perfected. In turn, this is causing women to be more insecure than ever by comparing themselves to something that isn't
even real. Technology and social media is altering our perception of reality and holding us to higher expectations that we cant even
achieve. Berger also mentions that in art objects look very realistic in painting and questions is what is “real” . Many people argue
that what is real is what you can hold in your hands but with new technology such as virtual reality there is a new definition of what
is real. If you are in a virtual reality and it feels real, does that give a new definition to the meaning? This is the first time 
reality and being realistic are merging together. For example, playing video games and receiving a medal for winning a tournament
is a real award even though you can not physically hold it. It still gives the same feeling of accomplishment and success without
the material item. Reality can now be justified as a feeling in this case. As technology advances I think this idea will expand
and soon many more realities will be virtual. Images are often used for advertising in 2019 in order to persuade  the buyer but
images are also used to change people's minds when it comes to social and political aspects of society. Pictures can change peoples 
beliefs and can also alter political opinions which is scarier than ever now with the ability to alter images. Fake news has become
an epidemic due to images altered through photoshop and it can be harder and harder to tell what is actually real.
