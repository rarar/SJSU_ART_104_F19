I am very interested in the sharing emonomy that you mentioned, but I did not find any of them during the reading.
I might miss some point. I grabed one sentense which is very useful for me: Does speed reading increase one's intelligence.:)

The underling meaning of the topic is to explain how internet tramsformed our way of living.

First, AI (machining learning)considered as an act of approprriation even though SS artist didn't express her opinion 
firmly, but I will use the sentence from the topic to explain what I am feeling: As the invention of new technology is
also the invention of a new type of accident such as subvert power relationship. 

Competitive and innovation are always stay together like brothers. When advanced technology can transform the genes to be more
intelligent and talented, People who can afford the price will try their best to make it changed. It like one's cosmetic
surgery is anoter one's psychic loss, still many people won't stop doing it because one's gaim is another one's loss. (From TED
Talk) People want to play a fair game. 

When robot became popular, they are sure to replace a lot of humane jobs. First, they will never get tired can be used forever
if costomer service is quality and effective. Employer will gain a lot of benefits from robotic labors in terms of buying
insurance, and family insurance, some housing or life subsidies, and food or something. They do not need to have coffee room
and kichen as well. Robot are all set without needing to be trained or education. Capitalist can use them immediately if they
need them to achieve something real quick. They will save a lot of their cost. Do you think they will give up the great 
opportunity to earn more money, make great company, or more powerï¼ŸI don't have any positive assumption about robot world. 

They will definitely have the potencial to motopolize the everything in the future.

Second, the implementation of AI
The darkside of earth is waiting for to discover, might have more resources that we can share and increase our quality of life;
Many landmine needed to be destroied which left behind by wars;
I saw many people clean the bathroom in HongKong airport;
I don't know how robot help disabled people because they need more care than regular people, I meant the emotional comfort/
If they are ok with robot rather than nobody especially in America, and I am not sure the robots can satisfy their needs if 
they want a kiss or hug. By contrast, if people can be satisfied by robots, they mas y menos as robot too.


Do we neend work in the future?
I do not think I am ok let robot work for me to earn living things for survive. If they can do anything, human-beings should
not necessary to be needed. I do not think this will happen. 

Whether Artist can chang the situation?
In this country given and taken hasn't ever balanced. After Trump's administration, the things become more serious. I think
selfish culture should be more than welcome robots to live within them. 
I do believe there are many scholars or many people are trying their best to change the current situation.
