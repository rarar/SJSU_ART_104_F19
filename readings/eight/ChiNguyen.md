**Reading Response #8**

**Chi Thien Nguyen:** I have just read the title for our latest article, Sebastian Schmieg’s Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web, and 
already I have an idea as to what to think about this essay. Well, I don’t want to be a robot! At least, not just because Schmieg tells me 
to with part of his title, Pretend to Be a Bot. I would rather make a fool out of myself instead because I want to! But you know what? 
Let’s just take a break from this reading response, shall we? Somebody, get me a drink while my attorney takes over. Oh, talk about 
show business!

**(long beep for “Please Stand By.”)**

**Chi’s lawyer:** Ladies and gentlemen, Chi Thien Nguyen would like to apologize for his previous immature behavior. Normally, Chi would jump 
around or playfully pat his stomach and laps because he would always feel like it. Sudden bursts of energy for no apparent reason, would 
send him into interpretative dances which help him express his fantasy adventures starring his cartoon friends. He loves his personal 
ballets since usually the audience is his parents, who would hardly tolerate them by the way, the stars of his stories are his friends in 
the Cartoon Kingdom, and most importantly, as the artist Chi has 100% creative control over his own plays. So, when Schmieg asks his 
audience to “pretend to be a bot”, albeit not personally, my client was pretty much offended by how someone was telling him what to do and 
who to be. But by now, my client has made a full recovery from his tantrum, so it’s safe to bring him back onstage for him to explain 
himself, regarding everything today. In fact, here he is now, take it away Mr. Nguyen!

**Chi:** Thank you for taking over for me, Mr. Tim. As my lawyer mentioned on my behalf, I was taken back by the assertive tone of just the 
title of Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web. But from what I first knew about science-fiction, human could not become robots with 
today’s techniques in science and technology. And even if they pretend or try to evolve into a new species like this, what kind of robots 
could we become? Could we humans transform ourselves into the archetypal robot, without hearts or souls at all; or into Kokoro AI robots 
of Astro Boy (2003 TV series), who can think and feel for themselves? 

I know very well that this recent commentary is me going off in a tangent in the first place, and I apologize for that. But then again, if 
I can get this excited over Schmieg’s article title alone, then I should get just as interested in his content as well. As far as I know, 
Schmieg is more than eager to discuss the kind of robot that automatically asks questions to human users while disguised as one itself, 
the true meaning of his use of the word “bot”. Like real robots would do, Schmieg’s observed software bots are programmed to do most heavy 
lifting on humans’ behalf. I don’t know anything about this ‘sharing economy’ I’ve heard about, but I should know something about bots 
myself, especially since bots ask me for my identity on the same fun websites I visit. Today’s digital landscape naturally demands more 
uses of the human brain, heart and soul than muscles anyway, unlike manual labor in the past. And yet, with the rise of this ‘ASI’, let 
alone new bots of artificial intelligence, Schmieg was right to think that a too optimized world might come with its own costs and benefits, 
especially with bot identities concealing those of humans too well. But at least Schmieg and I could agree on one good question: what 
mechanical beings are we humans becoming? For the record, I hope we can include cyborgs into our discussion next time. But for now, 
let us look forward to then. Somebody please get me another drink.

**The End**
