Response for extra-credit:
After watching this video, I felt that I found a friend that I could talk with even though we are at a different period. I felt someone was speaking the internal myself with sufficient knowledge more than twenty years ago that I know now. I wish people who live in mainland China could watch the video if it were not blocked. People who are from my country willing to know America and understand the Western countries to know what's going on. However, the infantile autism is prevalent in present society now. People barely know each other like the way they used to live thirty years ago. The social media separate them from one another even far than before, and father from the Western countries. I do not know if Noam Chomsky mentioned the future society should also include the relationship between countries of Eastern and Western. It should be very dangerous if the media between countries fight for their country's government or they cooperate together only for the sake of their interests by control the consumer market to create more wealth while poverties.

He also solved so many "whys" which have embedded in my mind for a long time. Why society is what it is now? I recorded some of his speech: it is not the case, as the naive might think, that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy. Instead, as this whole line of thinkers observes it's the essence of democracy... the point is that in a military state, or a feudal state, or what we would nowadays called a totalitarian state. It doesn't much matter what people think, because you've got a bludgeon over their head and you can control what they do. But when the state lost the bludgeon when you cannot control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem, it may make people so curious and so arrogant, that they don't have the humility to a civil rule. Therefore, you have to control what people think, used to be called propaganda, manufacture of consent, creation of necessary illusions...various ways of either marginalizing the general public or reducing them to apathy in some fashion."

Noam Chomsky mentioned that it does not matter how people think in a dictatorship society. That is the situation that many Asian countries are living in now. I went to one of my friends' home for celebrating Thanksgiving day last Thursday. We were accidentally talking about the problem of the Hong Kong protests. All the people were there from Hong Kong excepting me. I did not get a chance to express myself what position I held about Hong Kong protest, but they assumed that I disagreed with them because I am from mainland China, where almost all people disagree with Hong Kong's choice. I felt the environment was tense, so I left earlier after a few minutes. It is hard to argue or delivery the different thoughts under the bias and dictatorship society even though Hong Kong is more democratic was colonized by the British. Still, the culture and their parenting style have limited them to be more open mind to accept different views. I can feel the difference between America and any Asia countries. I thought that that's why Noam Chomsky's voice can be heard in American society. Many people were respecting his perspectives even under the pressure of so many opposing voices, and his persistence and his persistent supporters have shown the strengh of democracy from the autarchy society. The friction between different cultures has more contradictions but also has more freedom for people to hold different voices.

Chomsky indicated so many problems that are happening right now because people will have to lose the chances to access enough information and form their independent mind. Media isolate them without interacting with each other anymore. The majority of people have manipulated by advertisement and propaganda, and they also will be the most significant voice in the country under control. The essential sounds will be diminished and marginalized, which are substantial functions of democracy. How to achieve the rational liberation society must be organizations that are to let people gather together to delivery their thoughts and ideas in their interactions of their daily lives. He also suggested that might be a good way to lead people get rid of media; otherwise, let the society return to the historical period such as slave society and replay again and again and again...
