Doing nothing is more important than what people would like to think. That is exactly what the author of this article tries to point out. But today i such a busy lifestyle people are constantly caught up on the idea of what they have to do done next. After I finish this today what is the next thing I have to do. The author reminds us to take a break or sometimes just get away from that busy schedule you might have. I think this is something I try to do in my everyday life but it does not work out so well. I'm definitely still trying to learn how to master the art of doing nothing. Whenever I am doing nothing I can not help but think about all the things I could be doing while I am just sitting here. But what is even worse is sometimes when I am just packed busy with things, such as this semester I just get so stressed out I do nothing. When people become swamped with a lot of things to do I think there is a tougher time organziing on how to finish all of these things on time. I get stressed thinking about homework assignments, projects, tests, internship work, and then real work too. I think when it all collects together I stop working all together. During times like these I think it is much better to walk away and take a break and do nothing, somewhere quiet to relax. In a way I think it is similar to letting go of the bad thoughts in your head, the stress, the worries, and allow some space to create a solid plan on how to get everything done.
