In “How to do nothing,” Jenny Odell reminiscences about her time at the rose garden, a place that she often visits as a paradise away from her computer and the real working world, and inspired her to present her book.  It is essentially a deep insight into the things people perceive as important, productive or as part of day-to-day life. The author tries to bring people to a world where they can appreciate every moment of their unperturbed self. From the article, one comes to terms with the writer’s ideas of floating in a realistic world, where careers and other day-to-day activities do not dictate opinions. Odell encourages the reader to interact with the world as it is without having to analyze the various contexts. I agree with Odell’s visualization of the essence of “doing nothing” as espoused in the article evoked by her time at the rose garden. With solitude, one gets connected to the immediate world better, and without distractions.

A good example is evident in the manner that she explains her series of Satellite Landscapes; the author speaks of the beauty she perceives in viewing and showcasing some series of photos where she had removed the ground, so that the background is lacking. The exhibited objects and explanations provided make it evident that the author sees meaning   in restoring originality to objects and presenting them in their natural context.

The author expresses the satisfaction of taking time to watch birds and describes the details in a scenario she suggests should be renamed ‘bird noticing.’ Beautiful birds come to the rose garden, and contemplating them is a rare pleasure that takes time and “doing nothing.” Considering that the experience requires one to remain in one place, anticipating the manifestation of a bird through sight or sound, such moments should be very satisfying.

I believe that Jenny advocates a person taking that important time alone, deliberately engaging in solitude as a way of refreshing themselves, and thinking deeply of their inner self.  In essence, silence is a very important requirement and asset in one’s life, and a person must always look for important retreats with their inner self as a way of balancing their lives against its otherwise busy, preoccupied aspect.  An additional and different way that Jenny espouses the need for space to a person is sponsoring the preservation of public space as a way of ensuring that people can have that sanctuary for self-time free of any charge.  Jenny highlights the manner that governments and other stakeholders prefer to use space for purposes such as building condominiums, whereas it is important to allocate areas for practicing solitude.

Taking Jenny’s writing as a campaign for the importance of the need for people to reflect on their lives, I truly appreciate   the way that the author has succeeded, and the respect she has for people’s peace of mind. People must consider the world beyond the things that they become involved in, and daily appreciate the beauty of life. Seeing the conclusion Jenny’s father reached of realizing, on some quiet retrospection, that, all things considered, his job was good, I can understand that people should learn to appreciate what they have in life and by extension, be content with what fate offers to satisfy their needs.
