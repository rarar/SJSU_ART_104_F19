Reading 10 Response: 

“a failure the Surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico noticed as early as 1913:
In the face of the increasingly materialist and pragmatic orientation of our age … it would not be eccentric in future to 
contemplate a society in which those who live for the pleasures of the mind will no longer have the right to demand their 
place in the sun. The writer, the thinker, the dreamer, the poet, the metaphysician, the observer … he who tries to solve 
a riddle or to pass judgement will become an anachronistic figure, destined to disappear from the face of the earth like 
the ichthyosaur and the mammoth. (quoted in Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy and Uta Grosenick, Surrealism)”。

I genuinely agree with upon sentences because I felt that way too. Often time feeling guilty when I talk something unproductive
or without benefit for something or someone, it called: waisting time. We do not need to talk about personal sentimental or
emotional because these are an excrescent luxury. There are full of rules around the world, keep the rules to do what you aught to do, which means down to the earth. Life is whole of goals even play some hobbies have to achieve some levels; 
Otherwise, they are worthless. I do not see any life here? People are born to studying for working for achievement but not for a good life. It is too strict and diligent sometimes feeling breathless. 

Maintenance is essential definitely, but people need stimulation and ambition to do something to feel they are great and alive. Life is boredom for most of the time, and we repeat things every day. People need energy and novelty to delight the indefinite ruitines. Maintain are boring and harder than creation because love the new loathe the old is human nature. It takes a big and strong heart to persist be yourself regarding the temptations in the era of information explosion. To form a complete
thinking system, it takes a long time and effort to achieve. Those are difficult to coexist with the online fast-food culture.
I spent more than three years only for studying in GE classes in America without learning anything to help me with my job. 
When most people do not value GE class and tell me it wastes time and money, I persist in reading all the textbook even though
they were hard for me. My primary class just started from the last semester, I found I know nothing about the field since I gave my time away for my GE class before. I am experiencing in a hard time because nobody wanted to do a project with people like me. I may lower the grades rather than benefiting them. When talking about something, I found I am talking with air without single
feedback because those are not meat and rice. They do not need it. 

Contemptation, I wanted to laugh when I just came here. I needed to response everything immediately without thinking. I used to
meet a famous person in a grocery store a few years ago, and he told me that living life with philosophy is like a piece of pale bread but added jam. I deeply moved by his opinion, and I accept it and live my life combine with philosophy. People can live happier just let go of others and let go of self. 

In the long river of the universe, human existence is only an instant。 In the long stream of social time, the presence of an individual is only a small tiny point. Appreciating the majestic nature even enjoy the sunshine can lead us to be humble. We
will realise how little we are and many things are just so trivial. We will not take for granted from nature; instead, we will
be thankful and friendly to others. We will not overvalue ourselves and willing to spend more time with people. We will know every individual is precious and worth you to devote some time to them. They are all great even though they did not achieve any level. You never know when you do not think they deserve your time. Everyone should ask self some questions: how great you are? What you have to worth others to take? What makes you feel worthier with the computer rather than trusting people can benefit you more?

When you know you are nothing without someone else's existence, you will not take everything for granted without appreciation.
Everything we take is from nature. Let me figure out the process: first, we live with energy. Food is energy, fuel is energy,
sunshine is energy etc. How energy comes from?  Sun raised plants. Plants grew animals. Animals raised human. The human raised children. Without trees, we do not have fresh air and freshwater. Human is great, but nature is more significant than humans because
we are created by nature. No matter how many resources you have, we humans only have a 6-foot body and three meals with a bed.
Wisdom will lead people to have a happy life.
