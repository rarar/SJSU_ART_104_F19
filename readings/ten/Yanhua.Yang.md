“a failure the Surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico noticed as early as 1913:
In the face of the increasingly materialist and pragmatic orientation of our age … it would not be eccentric in future to 
contemplate a society in which those who live for the pleasures of the mind will no longer have the right to demand their 
place in the sun. The writer, the thinker, the dreamer, the poet, the metaphysician, the observer … he who tries to solve 
a riddle or to pass judgement will become an anachronistic figure, destined to disappear from the face of the earth like 
the ichthyosaur and the mammoth. (quoted in Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy and Uta Grosenick, Surrealism)”。
I am deeply agree with upon sentences because I felt that way too. Often time feeling guilty when I talk something unproductive
or without benefit for something or someone, because it is waisting time. We do not need to talk about personal sentimental or
emotionals because these are excrecent luxury. There are full of rules around the world, just keep the rules to do what you 
aught to do, which means down to the earth. Life is full of goals even play some hobbies have to achieve some leveles; 
otherwise, they are worthless. I do not see any life here? People are born for studying for working for achievement but 
not for a good life. It is too strict and religent sometimes feeling breathless. 

Maintainse is important definitely, but people need stimulation and ambition to do something to feel they are alive. Life 
are boredom for most of the time and we repeat things every day. We need energy and novety to delight the indefinite 
ruitines. Maintain are boring and harder than creation because love the new loathe the old is human nature. It takes a big 
and strong heart to persist be yourself regarding of the tempetations in the era of information explosion. To form a complete
thinking system, it takes a long time and effort to achieve, Those are difficult to coexist with the online fast food culture.
I spent more than three years only for studying in GE classes in America without learning anything to help me find a job. 
When most people do not value GE class and tell me it wastes time and money, I persist to read all the text book even though
they were hard for me. My major class just started from last sememster, I found I know nothing about the field since my time
gave away to my GE class before. I am experiencing in hard time becuase nobody wanted do project with people like me. I can 
not benefit them rahter than lowering the grades. When talking about something, I found I am talking with air without a single
feedback because those are not meat and rice. They do not need it. 

Templetation, I wanted to laugh when I just came here. I needed to response everything immediately without thinking. I used to
meet a famous person in glocery and he told me that living life with philosophy is like a peice of pale bread but added jam.
I deelp moved by his opinion, and I accept it to live with my life. People can live more happier let go of others and let go
of self. Appreciating the majestic nature can lead self to be humber and feel we are just a small point at this planet. We 
will feel appreciate things that take for granted and the people we have meet in the earth. 

I did not get moved by the artile because it is kind of pale and self-pity to express personal feelings. Many things can do 
if you keep your eyes far away not just the place you live.
