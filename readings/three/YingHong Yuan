Reading Response#03

        In the radio “New Way of Seeing” we have listened this week, it mentions a brand new idea different to “Way of Seeing” 
    by John Berger. In john’s piece, he explored how what we see is influenced by assumptions concerning beauty, truth, 
    taste, class and gender. But in the “New Way of Seeing,” while quoting the "Way of Viewing", revealing how the 
    production and development of science and technology affect human beings and gives mankind a new way of seeing and 
    thinking. 
	In the “Cybernetic Forests” of “New Way of Seeing,” James Bridle mentions that every technology invented by human 
    beings is a photograph. Although machines give people a cold feeling, they are created by human consciousness. 
    Technology is like a device that records the history of the whole world. It allows us to look at history and questions 
    from different angles and get different understandings. James points out we should admit that each person in the world
    can be a different sense of seeing a problem, and we should respect each other. He gives a metaphor “As the ice melts 
    in the arctic, the light reflects off snow and water in different ways. Climate change means that – literally – we see
    the world differently.” James also thinks that we should reconsider our relationships with machines like computers. 
    “By putting us back into correspondence with one another, we don’t just reanimate the possibilities of communication
    and imagination that underlaid the initial promise of the internet: we fundamentally reshape the network itself.” We 
    shouldn’t rely on machines to give us the answers to life,but should be seen the machines as another way of looking 
    at problems. 
	In the “Digital Justice” of “New Way of Seeing,”  Stephanie Dinkins gives an example that why we should not rely 
    on the machines：Amazon hopes to achieve equality by automating the process of selecting the most suitable employees, 
    but it results in more extreme inequality. People always neglect that intelligent systems are determined by human d
    ecision-making. Thus, Stephanie gives a way to solve the problem that is “The only way to ensure these technologies don’t 
    just repeat the mistakes of a past from which they’re supposed to be learning is by involving people who weren’t part of 
    that decision making before. And by increasing the diversity of people who build these systems, we’ll expand the range of 
    people who actually learn from the experience – not just about computers, but about how society itself works.” We need to
    make more people realized that the machines are not the things that help people to get the answer but is the thing to help
    us see the problem from a different way.
      	In the “Machine Visions” of New Ways of Seeing, John Berger states that how images change their nature and shape the 
    way how humans seeing. After many times of spread and being used, many images just being divorced from the original 
    meaning and regiven a meaning, has changed their very nature. In John’s view, the more images we look and the more
    confusing we are to see the truth. Since there are too many “fake“ images produced with bring the creator sense, nor 
    like ”way of seeing“ said that image as a tools to record what happened in history. The meaning has changed, many images 
    produced with a purpose. Therefore, john also gives a way is that “not to look at what the image shows, but look at how 
    the image shows and what the images avoid to show.” It is a brand new “seeing” way that we should learn today.
	Last but not least, in the “Invisible Networks” of New Ways of Seeing, Artists have revealed that the Internet is 
    everywhere in our lives. But because the environment we live in has not changed much, so we always ignore how much 
    the change of the network is.“When you understand what the internet looks like, and how it works, you can start to 
    “re-own” it.” People always think that the network is complex and irregular, but the reality is not.Because the 
    Internet is invisible in our lives, we need to find it and observe it more. Through its changes, we can observe the 
    changes of our world and discover the truth.
