In the podcast "New Ways of Seeing” based off the 1970s series with Jon Berger, James Bridle interviews different artists to discuss their experience with technology, art and how it affects the world around us. Technology and art are connected now more than ever. Now that technology has taken over a huge part of our lives it is open for interpretation and people have begun to realize that we don't even have control over what we see or how we see it anymore. The main source of communication in modern times is through the Internet, however the internet alone does not allow us to make connections. In the first episode of the podcast, Bridle points out that all of our communication through the internet is controlled through a few major companies such as Facebook and other social media platforms. It is crazy to think that so much power is being held by so few companies and that we can not communicate with each other virtually without going through them and giving them more power. Not only do they control how we talk to people but with their algorithms they control what we see and how we see it. They have the potential to manipulate an entire generation with a couple of posts. Even though this is an unlikely scenario its the capability that is somewhat worrisome. On a smaller scale of manipulation, these social media and news outlets can arrange posts in a certain way to make them have a different impact. As Berger explained, perspective is everything and what surrounds the information can be just as important as the information itself. Technology is more human than we give it credit to be, it is created by humans therefore it has similar ways of receiving information. In the second episode of the podcast, Bridle uncovers the dictrimation within technology. Most technology has been created by white men which has in the past given them an unfair advantage. Applications such as photoshop have also allowed new photos to be made that look completely realistic to the point where an average person would not be able to tell the difference  between the real and the fake. Bridle explained how one of the most famous war photos was completely manufactured yet had been used as a realistic representation of warfare. This has dramatically added to the rise of fake news because people tend to believe what the see. This can also be applied to how women compare themselves to others. Everywhere we look women are plastered on billboards, magazines, advertisements, and especially on our phones while scrolling through social media. Unfortunately most of these images are edited and posed to make the women look her “best” forcing girls to compare themselves to unrealistic standards. I believe that if women were not constantly compared to others and did not have to spend everyday looking at these campaigns they would have more confidence, power and an overall greater influence on the world. Instead they are constantly being put down and told they are not good enough which has resulted in an entire gender settling for good enough rather than pushing and believing that they deserve more. Not only is the media changing what is represented but in the long run they are decided who is represented and who will hold the power.
