	I need to complain that I can not fully understand without captions, but I did catch some points. :)
	
	First, technology changed the way we see things because of fake images. 
	I happened to read this saying "Advertisement is all about appearance", so all images have the mission to advertise products
	or people themselves. When artificial images everywhere or overused, people tend to accept it as natural without thinking.
	Resulting in people do not like the real and natural world, they treat people around them either good or bad depending on 
	their clothes and facial appearance. The huge stereotype has emerged between people whether they have money to own more
	possessions or not. Technology completely changed people's value from quality to quantity. It is hard to lead people to show
	true selves because they are worried about being judged by others. They have fake them for a long time unless they
	do not know who they are. It is a psychological threatening. 
	
	Second, 3D printing has been printed fire armed guns since 2012. People can buy a 3D printer at home to make everything they 
	wanted without concerning if it is legal. One of the woman scientists adopted other people's hair from the subway and used 
	their DNA 
	to make human through coding and 3D printing just like them. As the BBC audio said high-technology is advanced to the internet, 
	but the question is if the society is advanced to accept it. We are living in a digital society, everything is hidden without
	controlling by the physical world. If the education system is good enough, people can keep their social contracts not broken 
	laws.
	Think about Facebook, Google, DMV...many huge high-tech company seems hard to adhere to their principals. Youtube happened to 
	detete the videos about HongKong protests which were posted by Chinese.(Even though were some manipulated accounts but
  how did they know? It has been said they were fake videos. 
	Why Chinese do not have the rights to free speech to protect their opinions in America? It is dangerous that more and fewer 
	voices will be heard in the future. High-tech try the best to control everything while producing everything against social security. Everything is invisible but everything is controlled.
	
	Third, hacker, plagiarize, digital colonialism ...I wanna talk about women.....
