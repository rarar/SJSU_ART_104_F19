Reading Nine: Towards a Poetics of Artifical Super Intelligence
=================================

For reading 9 of the semester, please read Nora Khan's Toward a Poetics of Artifical Super Intelligence.

Think about the way that Ms. Khan is exploring the ideas that are laid out by Nick Bostrom. What are some of the potential ways that ASI's will change our society? How are ASI's different from other forms of AI?

As you think about the future of computing, how will ASI's effect our computational paradigms? Can you think of ways that AI is already changing the way that we use computers?
