## Design Fiction
### A short essay on design, science, fact and fiction.
#### Julian Bleecker - March 2009

Chapter 1:
In chapter 1, Julian Bleecker explains the meaning of design. One of the things he said about design is that "Design allows you to use your imagination and creativity explicitly." As a designer, I agree with him. The design process is not a one-way street. Design is a journey, an exploration that a designer can take using their creativity. Julian also stated that design can be in various forms, from service design to “computer design” or “database design” or “application design”.  He then raised a question "If design can be a way of creating material objects that help tell a story
what kind of stories would it tell and in what style or genre?" This is something I'd never thought about. It's such a broad question that I would not know where to begin. If I were to answer this question, I would need to think about what "type" of design is in the context? Is it all design? What is fact and fiction in design? When I hear the term "design fiction", I was thinking of design in an abstract form that tells a story, and "design fact" would be something related to designing a piece of software or hardware where it requires more accuracy and fact. Later in Chapter 1, Julian described and compares between science fiction and design fiction, this is where I start to understand the idea a bit more. 

>Science fiction can be understood as a kind of writing that, in its stories,
creates prototypes of other worlds, other experiences, other contexts for life-based on the creative insights of the author. Designed objects — or designed fictions — can be understood similarly. 

> Design fiction is a way of exploring different approaches to making things,
probing the material conclusions of your imagination, removing the usual
constraints when designing for massive market commercialization — the
ones that people in blue shirts and yellow ties call “realistic.”

When I see the comparison he did with science fiction and design fiction, that's when it comes to light. I do agree with him, that science fiction and design fiction shares one thing in common, which is "they are whatever story you want to tell". I think the statement he made was powerful because when you think about it, it's really about imaginary. y. "Design fiction is
about creative provocation, raising questions, innovation, and exploration." "Design fiction is a mix of science fact, design and science fiction. " Julien Bleecker gave out many definitions of what design fiction means throughout chapter 1.  I do want to say that the concept of design fiction is hard to get and to explain. I almost want to say it's like design and think outside the box, but not entirely just that. It involves bigger imaginary.

After finished chapter 2, I realized what I understood about design fiction is opposite of what I thought at first , which I mentioning in my 1st paragraph. In my understanding, it's a combination of design fiction and design fact. It a combination of science, technology, a piece of hardware, a piece of software, a prototype, an art piece, a design piece and a piece of imaginary. It's quite interesting. Design fiction is not fitting into just "technology" category or just "design" category. It's both. 

Then I got to chapter 3, this is where it makes more sense. After reading the subheader "Insights into how fact and fiction are all tangled up, anyway.", I realize, my idea about design fiction is correct, stated in the paragraph above.  In my honest opinion, design fiction is such a hard concept to understand in the first place. It's like, design for/in a futuristic world, but tells a story, but the story is not "clear", it's up to one's imaginary. The idea is too deep that I was having a hard time to understand the "core" definition of it. Or maybe it's not there to be understood at all, but for the mind to defines its own meaning.
