In Julian Bleeckers short essay on design, science, fact, and fiction, “Design Fiction”, he breaks down the meaning of design and how it is applied science and material objects. In chapter one, Beaker begins to explain design as something that has some thoughtful exploration going on behind the object. In other words, every part of the object is there for a reason in order to make the user experience as productive as possible. I completely agree with this idea and would even add that designers are always tested to question successful products and find new and unique ways to approach everyday tasks. Due to this problem solving aspect of design, Bleeker also points out how design is a combination of art and engineering. I particularly love the idea of intellect and creativity coming together to make the word a better pace. The two ideas seem to be completely opposite yet come together in harmony and actually work together beautifully to create form as well as function. This leads the author to the question, “If design can be a way of creating material objects that help tell a story what kind of stories would it tell and in what style or genre?”. He came to the conclusion that design could be the combination of fact and fiction and points out many similarities design has with science fiction. This reminds me of the discussion in class about the novel “Neuromancer” by William Gibson in which the author used his imagination and logic to lay out an entire design concept that basically predict the internet. If Gibson's ideas of science fiction had been combined with science fact, the internet, along with other technologies,  probably could have been around a lot sooner. Engineers solve problems and once something works they stick with it and make it happen. This is great except for the fact that there could still be better ways to solving a problem, and this is where I believe design would play an important role in collaborative work. The way a designer solves a problem is by coming up with a bunch of different solutions and pushing themselves to think out of the box in order to come up with the best solution. They take into account aesthetic, productibility, and overall user experience that just an engineer might overlook. In the example of Tom Sachs’ art piece, “Space Program”, he represents how creativity and science can work together to present a new idea. In the third chapter of the essay, Bleekers starts to intertwine fact and fiction in order to discuss what happens when in between the two. On one side, fictions are more of ideas and concepts that don't really have a future unless they possible. I think the fictions guide the facts to success. There are able to be hundreds of ideas or fictions before one fact comes into place. The fictions are what make it a design due to the thought and considerations that go into it. These two genes work so well together because they build off of each other  and you cant have design without one or the other.
