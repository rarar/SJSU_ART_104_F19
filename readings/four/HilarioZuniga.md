## Reading #4: Design Fiction

Bleecker begins his short essay with describing what design was in chapter 1. He goes over the process of creating a design. It is a journey that the designer must undergo with their creativity. While describing design Bleecker goes over the different types of design that there are. He says that there is service design, business design, product design, experience design, industrial design, circuit design, finance design, research design, computer design, application design, etc. As I continued to read chapter 1 another interesting topic was brought up by Bleecker. Design Fiction is a term that I had never heard until this reading. As I first read about it I did not understand it at all. My first thought was that design fiction was referring to a design that was never going to be able to be created. However, bleecker made some quotes in this chapter which changed the way that I saw this new term.

>Science fiction can be understood as a kind of writing that, in its stories, creates prototypes of other worlds, other experiences, other contexts for life-based on the creative insights of the author. Designed objects — or designed fictions — can be understood similarly.

Design fiction is a way of exploring different approaches to making things, probing the material conclusions of your imagination, removing the usual constraints when designing for massive market commercialization — the ones that people in blue shirts and yellow ties call “realistic.”

Design fiction is a hybrid, hands-on practice that operates in a murky middle ground between ideas and their materialization, and between science fact and science fiction

After reading these quotes I now understand that term better, however, I am still confused as to exactly what he means by it. Bleecker gives many different explanations to the definition of what he means by design fiction. However, it still remains a term that is difficult to understand. From what I read in this chapter I would say that design fiction is like telling a story of a design in which you aren’t limited to the constraints you might usually be held back by, for example like money or materials. Which could explain why he chooses to relate design fiction to science fiction, because in science fiction one is not constrained by the normal rules of science like the laws of physics. 

In chapter 2, I can easily say that I became confused as to what was being talked about. What I understood was that fact and fiction are intertwined. By that I mean that fiction leads to fiction and vice versa. There has to be some facts in order to lead to thoughts of fiction and there has to be thoughts of fiction to lead to some actual facts. Other than that I am confused as to what is being talked about. 

In chapter 3, I continue to grasp some of the concept, however, I am still confused as to what is meant. Design fiction is basically designing while walking the fine line between fiction and fact. In order to have influence from both facts and fiction and so that you don’t lean too much towards one side or the other. It is essentially speaking about how design is possible thanks to having thoughts of fiction and fact work together in order to make the design. Other than this I am not able to say that I fully understood the paragraph. I am even considering rethinking my thoughts of chapter 1. I feel as if I might be incorrect with my thoughts that I have for chapter 1.
