# Why Good Design Matters

Good design has been a priority to me because I care deeply about the effect an object has on the way we feel.
The chapter speaks baout design as apart of human, and having a huge impact on our life. I agree that design can provide a 
feeling of well-being, and it can lift our head to even better design. I think that the design of a tangible thing needs to 
consider the human element, even if the main interface isn't with a human our understanding of an object is always effected. 
The way I feel in the morning is changed on whether it's a sunny day or overcast, so for the things we can control, the things
we can desgn, should be more like the sunny weather. I drew from the chapter that designing for the human element also means 
designing for human problems, to nuture our ability to focus on the rest. I really liked the example of the legs in different
materials. this shows that desinging for humananity doesn't just involve the aesthetic, but it also involves the way something
works. I didn;t come up with this idea, yet the example of using wood vs silicone for the legs of Madame Tussauds shows us that 
it takes effort and trials sometimes to find where aesthetics meet functionality. Where problem solving appears elegant, and 
our eyes are eazed into the being of design that occupies our space. I belive that design is at its best when the object that 
solves our problems looks good doing it and makes us feel even better. Yet sometimes designs gives up a little of its problme 
solving, giving up some of the human benefit in order to benefit another human need, which is to look good. Sometimes it is worth
it to be more artistic and wear a flower-carved wooden leg and suffer the annoyance of wood over silicone. Yet wouldn't
it be better to have both worlds, again I believ that this is where design is at its best. It is as if the design is so elegant 
have to recognize it as art when at its pinnacle.

Which leads me to what makes the differnce between art and design. I find that design is often art when carried out for human 
sensory consumption in a fashion that either favors the aesthetic or is equally favoring of the functionality of an object. When 
design is crafted in such a way that aims to satisfy the human elemnt of emotion, then it becomes a type of art that is most likely
more proactive in its message that other art for the sake of art. Yet when art is applied in the opposite direction. When its aesthetic 
or structure may be compromised for functioning to deliver the artist message or action, it can be considered design. It is as if 
the art doestn just speak for the artist, but it may also in someway if even passive be doing some action for the artist. An action 
that the artist may have needed to design a work of art to put into motion. By that definition it is possible to say all art is designed
then but this isn't true. DuChamp has shown that art has no limits. It respects little to no boundries and often shifts in unpredictable directions.
Art is free to serve its own purpose. Design is bound to serve the action humans require of it. Atleast that is the best way I can describe my perception 
of a very blurred gradient between art and design.

In conclusion I believe that good desing matters because design like language described in the chapter is unavoidable. It surrounds
us and shapes our environment. It is spread throughout humanity and can feel like an organic reaction to the motion of a human. Yet 
we control it, working within natures boundires we twist, chip, shave and sculpt it into a new object. An object that if carefully 
designed can make other humans better off. If even for their mentla health, that is why good design matters.
