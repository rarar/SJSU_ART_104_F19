**Reading Response #6**

In my honest opinion, even the word “Xenofeminism” as described in Laboria Cuboniks’ Xenofeminist Manifesto: A Politics for Alienation; this
new word alone is already the first obstacle of a lesson I am learning from this art essay. So, first things first, we should find out its 
definition by parsing its grammatical structure. Having read Hamlet, I learned that the word “xenophobia” means “fear of strangers”, so 
“xeno-” must mean “strangers” since “phobia” already means “fear of”. Likewise, the SOCI 80 class of Social Problems which I previously took,
has emphasized what feminism is all about: helpfully giving women a voice in the world to equalize the number of opportunities for all genders.
Overall, my personal diagnosis leads me to discover the word “Xenofeminism” to give regards to alienated women, somehow. 

I would have asked myself and other people my next question about the Xenofeminist Manifesto: “Why would Cuboniks want to discuss women’s 
alienation in his or her essay”? But luckily, my common sense on the subject already led me to the answers I was looking for. Another way 
of thinking about women’s alienation is that men have been discriminating against women for most of history, as we have known already. But 
strangely enough, Cubokniks is deciding to embrace the good aspects of this form of discrimination; a form which, despite its name, was made 
mostly for everyone in general, not just for women. Under the new politics of alienation, we no longer have to live life and distribute 
rewards based on natural-born or preconceived limits, from the barriers of economics to the borders found in geography or even meritocracy. 
Rather, as both human beings and as philosophical “aliens”, we should just take pride from that fact that we normally don’t overthink things 
nor underestimate one another; all we have to do to embrace Cuboniks’ alien philosophy is accepting each other’s individual personalities 
and building said characters together. For having already taught me this character-growth lesson a long time ago, all credit actually goes 
to first and foremost Disney’s Zootopia.

Why then would anyone continue to count on technological utopianism to save the day in the long run? Certainly, both Zootopia and Who Controls 
the Internet? by Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, among other pieces of evidence, have proven that technology could only advance society as a whole 
at best, but not the group and personal relationships that make up that society. Thus, this is why Cuboniks’ true faith in alienation, regarding 
technology, lies in the formerly-oppressed minorities (women, queers, and other gender nonconformists) as they renovate the roles of our current 
machines to improve commerce, society, politics, economics and the environment. Although the demographic for Xenofeminism seems more expansive 
than just women, the movement is still feminism as well as “good discrimination”, in that it denounces the history of men exploiting reason to 
disregard women’s choices in every decision ever made for anything. It is no wonder that Laboria Cuboniks was creative and wise in writing 
Xenofeminist Manifesto: A Politics for Alienation: even he or she is especially eager to explore the world(s) of the alien (https://www.laboriacuboniks.net/).
