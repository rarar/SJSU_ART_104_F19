## Xenofeminism
### Laboria Cuboniks

Xenofeminism fights for equality in any aspect of lives including social and technology. At first, I was having a hard time understanding the word "Xenofeminism". Before starting the reading, I was guessing what it means after seeing the subheader "A Politic for Alienation". I guessed that this is written to /or for the future where they could see and learn from what we did wrong as a human race on feminism. However; as I start reading, it's not just about feminism. It's not just about women's rights. There's more to it. I believe that its definition was defined when Cuboniks stated: *"a future in which the realization of gender justice and feminist emancipation contribute to a universalist politics assembled from the needs of every human, cutting across race, ability, economic standing, and geographical position."* The idea of Xenofemist is that everyone deserves to be treated/ looked at/ served equally; that nobody should be discriminated against due to any reason. I find it interesting when Cuboniks said "We are all alienated", I can see that. I can see that in myself, I can see that from someone else...We're all alienated because of something.

One of the quotes stood out to me is

>Gender inequality still characterizes the fields in which our technologies are conceived, built, and legislated for, while female workers in electronics (to name just one industry) perform some of the worst paid, monotonous and debilitating labour. Such injustice demands structural, machinic and ideological correction.

I've been living in Silicon Valley for 10 years now, I can see that clearly how inequality in tech is real, alive and still exists. The conversation has opened up, everyone is talking freely about this issue, to the point where I feel like inequality in tech is being "normalized". It's getting to the point where people just accept things as how they are. And it just keeps being that way with no real fixes.

And that links to this.

>Its uses are fused with culture in a positive feedback loop that makes linear sequencing, prediction, and absolute caution impossible. Technoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, and gender non-conforming play an unparalleled role.

Because the system itself is a loop. Inequality was designed and built many years ago, where it was never really designed for everyone; it was a one-size fit all system. And that is what Xenofeminism is fighting for: to stop the one-size-fit-all social system. Cuboniks suggested that it's time to escape the old order of 'sex' because there are more than just 2 genders. In my personal opinion, I agreed. I've spent half of my life living in Vietnam, for the longest time, most people believe that there are only 2 genders: male and female. The mindset is so old that it is unacceptable. The culture norms stop people from being themselves because it's not natural. I agree with Xenofeminist's idea that we don't even know what natural is. What is considered natural and abnormal? So, *"If nature is unjust, change nature!"*
