I am grad that you share this topic with us even though it is obscure with many metaphors hard to understand, but most of the perspectives that I am feeling the same way when I was reading it. I admire some of the manifestos, but aslo desagree with some of the opinions too, and I wanted to know more about how they xenofeminism carry out their claim instead of some conceptual ideas in the future. 


Xenofeminism is a rationsim. Xenofeminism is gender-abolitionist. 
First, having learned some European and American art history and knowing that there always are poeple trying to use particular language to define their group and their purposes of groups. Some of them have done very good jobs and became a symbol too. I am just wondering this kind of forms. Like homesexual defines them as queers. It made me thinking the trade war between America and China. People can unite the whole world to do the right things regardless which group they are belong is more harmounious and un-bias.

Xenofeminism mentions that they wanted to liberated abolitionist -- abolition of lcass, gender, and race and wanted to reinvention of family structure and domestic life under the partriarchy.
