Thinking about the ways technology can be used to better serve us is means that we need to think of 
better ways it can serve us all. The start of the article made me agree that technology has
not served all of humanity in that it leaves some of the largest groups of us unrepresented in the 
structure that is shaping tomorrow. I especially liked the outlook on why this is. Diversity is 
lacking at the very source. Xenofeminism remarks to the source as a patriarchal network. Futhermore
the freedom Xenofeminism wants is not just from the lack of representation but also the freedom from having
to combat the source in the very first place. It seems aparent that they would only have to combat if there is no one that 
can relate to them, no one to stand for the use of technology in their favor. I find that technology shapes
the landscape of my life and the people all around me. Every day our lives are measured and marketed to 
so that we stay content in the loop of consumption and work. It may sound depressing or shallow but the "oppurtunities 
afforded by developing forms of technological mediation should no longer be put to use in the exclusive interests
of capital, which, by design, only benefits the few." Although I dont fully agree because it must benefit us all 
a little, but that is how we are kept in the loop to benefit the few more. I think there can be ways to change this.
Maybe it will take the type of visceral rejection that XF seems to call for. For example this sentence, "it is a transformation of deliberate construction, seeking to submerge the white-supremacist capitalist patriarchy in a sea of procedures that soften its shell and dismantle its defenses, so as to build a new world from the scraps."
would elude that the solution is to burn it all down. Maybe, but I fear that fromt he ashes a worse enemy will arise.
Right now there is still some form of democratic sacrety that exist on the web. I believe in resourceful people, and I think we can make the current system as strong as it works in the favor of the few, has the potential to favor the many.
I dont know how, but I think the first step is a true platform for free-speech, and the web can still host.
